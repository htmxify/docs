- [inline-template](./extensions/inline-template.md), an extension that uses Handlebars to compile templates, allowing the use of JSON APIs in HTMX.
- [local-storage](./extensions/local-storage.md), an extension that allows using values from localStorage as request headers and setting values in localStorage as response headers
- [error-handler](./extensions/error-handler.md), an extension that adds a div with class "danger" when an error occurs in sending a request or if the server responds with a non-200 status code.
